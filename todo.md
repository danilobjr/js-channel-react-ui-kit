1 - OK - Maybe Checkbox should receive a label (be component or not) and not put it hardcoded like I did with CheckboxLabel
2 - OK - Maybe font-size should not be setted up by CardBody
3 - OK - Pass ...others props to all components
4 - OK - Remove 'open' props from Drawer

7 - Maybe extract components from FloatingInput
8 - Include a left component to AppBar (to be in place instead of default menu-icon button)
09 - OK - Maybe remove default width: 100vw; of AppBar. Try use width: 100%
